      <h1>Programing</h1>
      <p>Yes, I know saying my hobby is the same as my major is kind of a cop-out, but it's true. I love programming, so I'm going to use this as an opportunity to show some of my. Interesting work I've been doing as a hobby. I've been using a super fun language called Gleam in my free time. Gleam is a functional language that compiles into Elixir and Javascript, and it has quickly become my favourite language of all time. I want to use this hobby document to show why Gleam is so cool. But before we begin I want to hear from you whats your favourite language!</p>
